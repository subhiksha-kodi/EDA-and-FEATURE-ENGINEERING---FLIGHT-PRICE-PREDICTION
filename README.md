# 📦 **Product Data Analysis – Price & Weight Changes**

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project analyzes a dataset of 100 products to study *price* and *weight changes* over time.  
By comparing *before* and *after* values, we identify trends, calculate differences, and uncover patterns in product pricing and packaging.
