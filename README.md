Flight Price Prediction
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate flight prices using historical flight data. By analyzing features such as journey date, airline, origin, destination, and other flight details, the model provides accurate price predictions to assist travelers and airlines in decision-making.

Dataset Description

Training Dataset (data_train): Contains historical flight records with actual prices. This dataset is used to train and validate the prediction model.

Test Dataset (test_set): Contains flight details without price information. The trained model will generate price predictions for this dataset.

Key Features

The datasets typically include:

Date of Journey

Departure and Arrival Times

Source and Destination Cities

Flight Duration

Number of Stops

Airline

Other relevant flight-related attributes

How to Use

Utilize the training dataset to preprocess data, engineer features, and train your machine learning model.

Apply the trained model to the test dataset to predict flight prices for unseen flights.

Project Structure

data_train: Excel file containing the training data.

test_set: Excel file containing the test data for prediction.

Supporting scripts or notebooks for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.

Requirements and Considerations

Familiarity with data preprocessing and feature engineering for tabular data.

Understanding of machine learning modeling and evaluation techniques.

Handle missing data and categorical variables carefully to ensure model accuracy.

Model performance depends on the quality of data and choice of algorithm.
